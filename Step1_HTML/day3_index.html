            Third Day of Learning HTML
        </h1>

        <p title="Paragraph tag in HTML">
            The HTML element <i>&lt;p&gt;</i> defines a new paragraph. It always starts from a new line and some
            white space is automatically added before and after a paragragh by the browsers.
        </p>

        <p title="Extra lines ignored by browser.">
            This paragraph
            contains a lot of lines
            in the source code,
            but the browser
            ignores it.
        </p>

        <p title="Extra spaces ignored by browser.">
            This        paragraph
            contains        a lot of spaces
            in the              source code,
            but the         browser
            ignores         it.
        </p>

        <p title="About HTML display">
            With HTML, the display cannot be changed by added extra spaces or lines in the code. That's because
            large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results. So, the browser ignores
            the extra spaces or lines in the source code.
        </p>

        <p title="Horizontal Rule tag in HTML">
            The <i>&lt;hr&gt;</i> tag defines a thematic break in the page, often displayed as a 
            horizontal rule, like the one above. It is an empty tag.
        </p>

        <p title="Break tag in HTML">
            I will break the line here <br>
            with the help of <i>&lt;br&gt;</i> tag. <br>
            This sentence appears in a new line. This tag is an empty tag.
        </p>

        <p title="Preformatted tag in HTML">
            This paragraph contains a poem below within preformatted tag.
            <pre>
                Twinkle twinkle little star,
                How I wonder what you are!
                Up above the world so high,
                Like a diamond in the sky.
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p title="Styles attribute in HTML">
            The attribute <i>style</i> in HTML is used to add styles to an attribute.
            It has the syntax - <br>
            &lt;<i>tagname style="property: value;"</i>&gt; <br>
            where property and value are CSS objects. <br>
            In today's webpage, I have added the background-color and (font) color properties to the 
            body of the webpage. And, for the heading, I have added the text-align, font-family, and
            font-size property. 
        </p>

        <p title="Text formatting in HTML">
            <b>This text is bold, without any extra importance. It is inside the &lt;b&gt; tag.</b> <br>
            <strong>This text is bold and important. It is inside the &lt;strong&gt; tag.</strong> <br>
            <i>This text is italic. It is inside the &lt;i&gt; tag.</i> <br>
            <em>This is an emphasized text in italic, which is read with a verbal stress. It is insde the 
                &lt;em&gt; tag.
            </em> <br>
            <small>This is some smaller text. It is inside the &lt;small&gt; tag.</small> <br>
            <mark>This text is highlighted. It is inside the &lt;mark&gt; tag.</mark> <br>
            <del>This sentence is inside the &lt;del&gt; tag, denoting that it is a deleted sentence.
                Browsers usually strike a line for this element as you can see here.
            </del> <br>
            <ins>This text is inside the &lt;ins&gt; tag, denoting that it is an inserted sentence.
                Browsers usually underline the text as you can see here.
            </ins> <br>
            This word is <sub>subscripted</sub> with the help of the &lt;sub&gt; tag. <br>
            This word is <sup>superscripted</sup> with the help of the &lt;sup&gt; tag. <br>
