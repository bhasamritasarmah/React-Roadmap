            Lowercase is recommeded for HTML tags. So, &lt;p&gt; and &lt;P&gt; are the same, but the former
            is prefered to the latter one. <br>
            Lowercase is recommeded for attribute names too. <br>
            It is recommeded to always use quotes for attribute values. Either single or double quotes can be
            used, but using double quotes is the standard. <br>

                link
            </a> to the React Learning Roadmap. Here, the <i>&lt;a&gt;</i> tag defines a hyperlink, and the 
            <i>href</i> attribute specifies the URL which it will link to. <br>
            Attributes like this provide additional information about an element and are always 
            specified in the start tag. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="images/tiger.jpg" alt="Royal Bengal Tiger" width="200" height="142"> <br>
            The <i>&lt;img&gt;</i> is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The <i>src</i> attribute specifies
            the path for that image. <br>
            The <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> attributes define the width and height of an image, respectively, 
            in pixels. <br>
            The <i>alt</i> attribute contains the alternate text to be displayed in case an image is unavailable.
        </p>

        <p style="color:red">
            The <i>style</i> attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <i>lang</i> attribute should always be added inside the <i>&lt;html&gt;</i> tag to specify the
            language of the webpage. This explicit specification helps search engines and browsers. <br>

                country codes
            </a> for HTML webpages. <br>
            This webpage specifies its language as Indian English (en-IN).
        </p>
        
        <p title="About title attribute">
            The <i>title</i> attribute displays some extra information about an element, which will be displayed
            as a tooltip when the mouse is hovered over that element. <br>
            For example, the title for this element says "About title attribute".
        </p>

        <p title="HTML Headings">
            The HTML headings are defined with the <i>&lt;h1&gt;</i> to <i>&lt;h6&gt;</i> tags. Search engines
            use headings to index the structure and content of a webpage. <br>
            To change the default size of a heading, we can use the <i>style</i> attribute and <i>font-size</i>
            CSS-property. For example, <br>
            <h1 style="font-size: 60px">This Heading</h1>
        </p>
